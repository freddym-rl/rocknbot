## 4. Notes For Future Enhancements

### 4.1 Feature todos
Conversation analysis - IDDM and IDA
    Retrieval issues:
    1. 0 chunks were retrieved. Could be:
        Document issue (missing content)
        Badly formulated query
        Complex query requiring detective work (Use multihop retrieval?)
    2. Relevant chunks were not retrieved.
        Embedding issue (caused by embedding after chunking)
        Badly formulated query
        Content spread across multiple documents
    -----
    Reranker issue
    1. Irrelevant chunks in top 10
    -----
    Generation issues: LLM needs to be good at ignoring irrelevant chunks (use ReFT?)
    1. Incorrect answer - complete hallucination, completely irrelevant. Did not understand query at all.
    2. Incomplete answer - correct, but missing crucial information that was retrieved but not used
    3. Correct answer but with additional irrelevant content

Send the 10 chunks from which the answer was generated, back with the answer
    How to format this nicely? "Top 10 Retrieved Document Chunks:" section?
    Allow user to thumbs up/down individual chunks (checkbox to check/uncheck all chunks? How to do this in Slack?)

High pri tasks:
    Performance improvement "experiments" - Different reranker library, Stream all LLM output
    Late embedding - will need to build a test dataset of queries where no answer or irrelevant answer
    Retrying with a larger "reasoning" model if user gives a thumbs-down AND the answer is not "I cannot find an answer..." (Hypothesis: this might remedy some "incorrect" or "irrelevant" answers that are LLM generation issue).
        Could also try using Hyde in case it is a badly formulated query issue
    Integrating golden QA pairs with current information retrieval process for better answers based on golden QA pairs
    Building smoke tests to qualify a release - a set of "hard" questions that the chatbot had previously failed on
    Login and conversation history
    Automatically adding to the golden QA pairs repo if experts thumbs-up their own reply in Slack
        Automatically build a golden QA pair. Expert can always review and tweak the QA in the repo.
        Can we do this in the web app too? (requires login and tagging expert email id)
    Multimodal support - retrieve images and embed in answers

Additional content:
    Summaries of #techsupport content with PII redacted
    Agent that searches whitelisted web sites content
    Summaries from ZenDesk content with PII redacted?

### 4.2 - DevOps todos
* Lil Lisa ECS deployment - Point to the admin channels, not the main channels (Freddy takes care of staging, there's no prod). How to configure Slack to support multiple Slackbots subscribed to Slack?
* LanceDb - should not be part of Docker. Rebuild LanceDb's at deployment time. Server app should be able to execute init_docs() with an empty db. if db exists, do nothing. if no db, call rebuild_docs()
* Speedict - current implementation does not support concurrent slackbots. Switch to Redis or some other open source redis clone that is faster (IMDB). Support key/value, and in-memory cache.
* Size of docker images - optimize!
* Establishing a workflow for continuous improvement on some metric using eval/observability framework(?) and setting up a process, and the UX to go along with it. Track thumbs up/down, type of issue with answer etc. Need good metrics!
* Switch to GPU to speed up reranking
